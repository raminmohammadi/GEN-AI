# Week 2: Regularization and Model Generalization

Welcome to Week 3! This week's session dives deep into **Regularization techniques** aimed at improving neural network performance by preventing overfitting and enhancing model generalization.

## Topics Covered:

- **Regularization Fundamentals**
  - Introduction to regularization and its significance in neural networks
  - Strategies for smoother learning and improved model robustness

- **Stein's Unbiased Risk Estimator (SURE)**
  - Understanding the bias-variance tradeoff
  - Introduction to the concept of unbiased risk estimation
  - Real model vs. estimated model: Bridging the gap

- **Expected Error and Model Evaluation**
  - How to quantify model performance realistically
  - Concept of expectation and its role in model averaging (ensemble methods)

## Learning Objectives:
By the end of this week, you should be able to:
- Understand and apply regularization methods to enhance model performance.
- Clearly articulate the concepts behind Stein's Unbiased Risk Estimator and its implications for modeling.
- Recognize and quantify the difference between real-world models and the models you develop.
- Evaluate and interpret the expected errors of your predictive models using ensemble and averaging techniques.

Stay tuned, and let's keep exploring these foundational ideas to build stronger, more reliable AI models!

        "    * Increase the number of convolutional layers in the encoder and decoder.\n",
        "    * Use higher filter sizes for earlier layers to capture more facial details.\n",
        "    * Example: Start with 32 filters in the first layer and double the number of filters with each additional layer (e.g., 32 → 64 → 128 → 256).\n",
        "\n",
        "  * **Residual Connections:**\n",
        "\n",
        "    * Use residual blocks (skip connections) in both encoder and decoder to help the model capture finer details.\n",
        "    * This prevents loss of information as data passes through deeper layers, aiding better reconstruction.\n",
        "\n",
        "  * **Leverage Upsampling Layers in Decoder:**\n",
        "\n",
        "    * Instead of Conv2DTranspose, use a combination of UpSampling2D and Conv2D layers. This can often improve the quality of generated images, especially for faces, as it helps retain image detail.\n",
        "2. **Optimize the Latent Space**\n",
        "  * **Increase Latent Dimension:**\n",
        "    * Increase the latent dimension size from 50 to a higher value like 100 or 128, giving the model more capacity to encode complex face details.\n",
        "\n",
        "  * **Beta-VAE:**\n",
        "    * Scale the KL-divergence term with a coefficient (beta) in the VAE loss function to control the trade-off between reconstruction quality and latent space regularization. A larger beta (e.g., 4 to 10) enforces a more structured latent space but may reduce reconstruction quality. Find a balance through experimentation.\n",
        "3. **Regularization Techniques**\n",
        "  * **Dropout:**\n",
        "  Add dropout layers in both the encoder and decoder to prevent overfitting. Dropout rates between 0.3 to 0.5 can help generalize better, especially for large datasets like CelebA.\n",
        "\n",
        "  * **Batch Normalization:**\n",
        "  Add batch normalization after each convolutional layer, particularly in the encoder. This can stabilize training and help the model learn faster.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Improving Loss Functions**\n",
        "  * **Perceptual Loss (Content Loss):**\n",
        "\n",
        "    * Instead of relying solely on pixel-wise mean squared error for reconstruction, use a perceptual loss. Compute this loss using a pre-trained model (like VGG) on the reconstructed images and the original images, comparing them at higher feature levels.\n",
        "\n",
        "  This helps the model capture high-level features, like facial structures and expressions.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Training Techniques**\n",
        "  * **Learning Rate Scheduler:**\n",
        "\n",
        "    * Use a learning rate scheduler that decays the learning rate as training progresses, such as the cosine decay or exponential decay scheduler.\n",
        "  * **Data Augmentation:**\n",
        "\n",
        "    * Add slight data augmentations (like horizontal flipping, random cropping, or brightness adjustments) to introduce diversity and help the model generalize better.\n"

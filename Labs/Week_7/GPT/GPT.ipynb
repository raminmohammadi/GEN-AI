        "* **Text & Position Embed:** Input text is converted into embeddings, which include information about the words and their positions in the sequence.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Masked Multi Self Attention:** This layer allows the model to focus on different parts of the text by computing attention scores. The \"masked\" part ensures the model predicts the next word based on previous words only.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Layer Norm and Residual Connections:** Each layer uses layer normalization to stabilize and accelerate the training process. Residual connections (indicated by the \"+\" signs) help in improving the gradient flow through the network.\n",

        "* **Feed Forward Layer:** A fully connected feed-forward network applies transformations to the attention outputs. It processes each position independently and identically.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Repetition (12x):** The model repeats the attention and feed-forward layers 12 times, indicating a 12-layered Transformer block.\n",

        "As *ad-hoc* decoding methods, *top-p* and *top-K* sampling seem to produce more fluent text than traditional *greedy* - and *beam* search on open-ended language generation.\n",
        "Recently, there has been more evidence though that the apparent flaws of *greedy* and *beam* search - mainly generating repetitive word sequences - are  caused by the model (especially the way the model is trained), rather than the decoding method, *cf.* [Welleck et al. (2019)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.04319.pdf). Also, as demonstrated in [Welleck et al. (2020)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.02492), it looks as *top-K* and *top-p* sampling also suffer from generating repetitive word sequences.\n",
        "\n",
        "In [Welleck et al. (2019)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.04319.pdf), the authors show that according to human evaluations, *beam* search can generate more fluent text than *Top-p* sampling, when adapting the model's training objective.\n",
        "\n",
        "Open-ended language generation is a rapidly evolving field of research and as it is often the case there is no one-size-fits-all method here, so one has to see what works best in one's specific use case.\n",
        "\n",
        "Good thing, that *you* can try out all the different decoding methods in `transfomers` 🤗.\n",
        "\n",
        "That was a short introduction on how to use different decoding methods in `transformers` and recent trends in open-ended language generation.\n",
        "\n",
        "Feedback and questions are very welcome on the [Github repository](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers).\n",

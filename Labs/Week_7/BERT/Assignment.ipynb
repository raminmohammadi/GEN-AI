        "\n",

        "\n",
        "   - **Tokenization:** Transforms the text data into tokens that BERT can process.\n",
        "   - **Settings:**\n",
        "     - `max_length=384`: Ensures the sequences do not exceed 384 tokens, a practical length that fits within BERT's constraints of 512 tokens (considering special tokens added by BERT).\n",

        "     - `stride=128`: Allows a sliding window approach by overlapping context parts by 128 tokens, improving the chance of context coverage.\n",
        "     - `return_overflowing_tokens=True`: Keeps all splits from truncated contexts, resulting in multiple input sets for contexts longer than `max_length`.\n",

        "5. **Handling Answers Outside the Context Span:**\n",

        "The model training is responsible for configuring the training process and optimizing the BERT model's performance on the SQuAD dataset. Here's a breakdown of the steps involved:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Dataset Preparation**:\n",
        "\n",
        "   - **Conversion to TensorFlow Dataset**: Utilizes BERT's `prepare_tf_dataset` method to convert the preprocessed tokenized dataset into a TensorFlow dataset format suitable for training.\n",
        "   - **Batching and Shuffling**:\n",
        "     - `shuffle=True` for the training set ensures that each epoch sees data in a different order, promoting better model generalization.\n",
        "     - `batch_size=16` defines the number of samples processed before updating the model, balancing memory use and training speed.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Training Callbacks**:\n",
        "\n",
        "   - **EarlyStopping**: Halts training if the validation loss does not improve for 2 consecutive epochs, preventing further overfitting and saving computational time.\n",
        "   - **ModelCheckpoint**: Saves the model only when it achieves a new lowest validation loss, ensuring the best-performing model is retained.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Model Fitting**:\n",
        "\n",
        "   - **Training Execution**: The `fit` method iteratively optimizes the model parameters over the training data for the specified number of epochs.\n",
        "   - **Epochs**: Determines how many times the entire training dataset will pass through the model. Adjust depending on performance and overfitting.\n",
        "   - **Validation**: Continuously evaluates the model's performance on a separate validation dataset to monitor overfitting and generalization capabilities.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Model History**:\n",
        "   - **Output Analysis**: The `history` object stores details about the training process, such as loss and accuracy metrics for each epoch, which can be plotted for performance evaluation.\n",

    "**Instruction tuning** is a technique used to enhance the performance of large language models (LLMs) by fine-tuning them on datasets containing instruction-output pairs.

    "This flowchart illustrates the complete instruction tuning pipeline and inference process. Let me break down each component:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Pre-trained Language Model:**\n",
    "The starting point is a base language model that has already been trained on large amounts of text data. This model has general language understanding capabilities but hasn't been specifically optimized for following instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Fine-tuning on Instruction Dataset:**\n",
    "This stage involves training the base model on carefully curated instruction-response pairs. The model learns to understand and respond to specific instructions through this process, adapting its weights to better handle directed tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Instruction-tuned Model:**\n",
    "The resulting model after the fine-tuning process is now specialized in understanding and responding to instructions. It maintains the base knowledge from pre-training but has enhanced capabilities for following specific directives.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **User Prompt:**\n",
    "This represents the actual input from users - questions, instructions, or tasks that they want the model to process. It's separate from the training process and represents the real-world usage of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Inference:**\n",
    "This is the decision-making stage where the instruction-tuned model processes the user prompt. The model applies its learned knowledge to interpret the prompt and determine an appropriate response.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Generated Response:**\n",
    "The final output produced by the model in response to the user prompt. This represents the model's attempt to fulfill the given instruction or answer the question based on its training.\n",
    "\n",
    "The flowchart effectively shows how the model evolves from a general-purpose language model to a specialized instruction-following system, and how it ultimately processes user inputs to generate appropriate responses.\n",

    "## LoRA Instruct-tuning\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='assets/lora.png' width=500>\n",
    "\n",
    "### What exactly is LoRA?\n",
    "\n",
    "Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) is a parameter-efficient fine-tuning technique for\n",
    "LLMs. It freezes the weights of the LLM, and injects trainable\n",
    "rank-decomposition matrices. Let's understand this more clearly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assume we have an `n x n` pre-trained dense layer (or weight matrix), `W0`. We\n",
    "initialize two dense layers, `A` and `B`, of shapes `n x rank`, and `rank x n`,\n",
    "respectively. `rank` is much smaller than `n`. In the paper, values between 1\n",
    "and 4 are shown to work well.\n",
    "\n",
    "### LoRA equation\n",
    "\n",
    "The original equation is `output = W0x + b0`, where `x` is the input, `W0` and\n",
    "`b0` are the weight matrix and bias terms of the original dense layer (frozen).\n",
    "The LoRA equation is: `output = W0x + b0 + BAx`, where `A` and `B` are the\n",
    "rank-decomposition matrices.\n",
    "\n",
    "LoRA is based on the idea that updates to the weights of the pre-trained\n",
    "language model have a low \"intrinsic rank\" since pre-trained language models are\n",
    "over-parametrized. Predictive performance of full fine-tuning can be replicated\n",
    "even by constraining `W0`'s updates to low-rank decomposition matrices.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Number of trainable parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's do some quick math. Suppose `n` is 768, and `rank` is 4. `W0` has\n",
    "`768 x 768 = 589,824` parameters, whereas the LoRA layers, `A` and `B` together\n",
    "have `768 x 4 + 4 x 768 = 6,144` parameters. So, for the dense layer, we go\n",
    "from `589,824` trainable parameters to `6,144` trainable parameters!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why does LoRA reduce memory footprint?\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though the total number of parameters increase\n",
    "(since we are adding LoRA layers), the memory footprint reduces, because the\n",
    "number of trainable parameters reduces. Let's dive deeper into this.\n",
    "\n",
    "The memory usage of a model can be split into four parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Model memory: This is the memory required to store the model weights. This\n",
    "will be slightly higher for LoRA than the original model.\n",
    "- Forward pass memory: This mostly depends on batch size, sequence length, etc.\n",
    "We keep this constant for both models for a fair comparison.\n",
    "- Backward pass memory: This is the memory required to store the gradients. Note\n",
    "that the gradients are computed only for the trainable parameters.\n",
    "- Optimizer memory: This is the memory required to store the optimizer state.\n",
    "For example, the Adam optimizer stores the \"1st moment vectors\" and\n",
    "\"2nd moment vectors\" for the trainable parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since, with LoRA, there is a huge reduction in the number of trainable\n",
    "parameters, the optimizer memory and the memory required to store the gradients\n",
    "for LoRA is much less than the original model. This is where most of the memory\n",
    "savings happen.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why is LoRA so popular?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Reduces GPU memory usage;\n",
    "- Faster training; and\n",
    "- No additional inference latency."

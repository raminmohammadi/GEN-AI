    "This flowchart illustrates the complete instruction tuning pipeline and inference process. Let me break down each component:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Pre-trained Language Model:**\n",
    "The starting point is a base language model that has already been trained on large amounts of text data. This model has general language understanding capabilities but hasn't been specifically optimized for following instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Fine-tuning on Instruction Dataset:**\n",
    "This stage involves training the base model on carefully curated instruction-response pairs. The model learns to understand and respond to specific instructions through this process, adapting its weights to better handle directed tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Instruction-tuned Model:**\n",
    "The resulting model after the fine-tuning process is now specialized in understanding and responding to instructions. It maintains the base knowledge from pre-training but has enhanced capabilities for following specific directives.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **User Prompt:**\n",
    "This represents the actual input from users - questions, instructions, or tasks that they want the model to process. It's separate from the training process and represents the real-world usage of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Inference:**\n",
    "This is the decision-making stage where the instruction-tuned model processes the user prompt. The model applies its learned knowledge to interpret the prompt and determine an appropriate response.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Generated Response:**\n",
    "The final output produced by the model in response to the user prompt. This represents the model's attempt to fulfill the given instruction or answer the question based on its training.\n",
    "\n",
    "The flowchart effectively shows how the model evolves from a general-purpose language model to a specialized instruction-following system, and how it ultimately processes user inputs to generate appropriate responses.\n",

    "LoRA is based on the idea that updates to the weights of the pre-trained\n",

    "The memory usage of a model can be split into four parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Model memory: This is the memory required to store the model weights. This\n",

    "- Forward pass memory: This mostly depends on batch size, sequence length, etc.\n",
    "We keep this constant for both models for a fair comparison.\n",
    "- Backward pass memory: This is the memory required to store the gradients. Note\n",
    "that the gradients are computed only for the trainable parameters.\n",
    "- Optimizer memory: This is the memory required to store the optimizer state.\n",
    "For example, the Adam optimizer stores the \"1st moment vectors\" and\n",
    "\"2nd moment vectors\" for the trainable parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since, with LoRA, there is a huge reduction in the number of trainable\n",
    "parameters, the optimizer memory and the memory required to store the gradients\n",
    "for LoRA is much less than the original model. This is where most of the memory\n",
    "savings happen.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why is LoRA so popular?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Reduces GPU memory usage;\n",
    "- Faster training; and\n",
    "- No additional inference latency."

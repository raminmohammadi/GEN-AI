        "**BERT** was introduced by Google in a research paper titled \"[BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding](arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805)\" in 2018.\n",
        "\n",
        "BERT revolutionized natural language processing (NLP) by enabling deep bidirectional context in language models. This means it considers the context from both the left and right of a word during training, allowing for better understanding of word meanings in context."

        "\n",
        "1. **Input Layer:**\n",
        "\n",
        "  * The input text is tokenized into individual words or subwords (t1, t2, t3, etc.).\n",
        "  * Each token is represented by a numerical embedding.\n",
        "  * Positional encoding is added to the embeddings to provide the model with\n",
        "  * information about the relative position of each token in the sequence.\n",
        "2. **Transformer Encoder:**\n",
        "\n",
        "  * This is the core of the BERT model. It consists of multiple layers (typically 12 in the original BERT model) that process the input sequence in parallel.\n",
        "  * Each layer contains two main components:\n",
        "  * Multi-Head Attention: This layer allows the model to weigh the importance of different parts of the input sequence when processing a particular token. It can capture long-range dependencies in the text.\n",
        "  * Feed-Forward Neural Network: This layer applies non-linear transformations to the input, helping the model learn complex patterns.\n",
        "  * After each layer, an \"Add & Norm\" operation is applied, which involves adding the input to the output of the layer and then normalizing the result. This helps stabilize the training process.\n",
        "3. **Classification Layer:**\n",
        "\n",
        "  * The final layer of the model is a classification layer, which is used to make predictions based on the input sequence.\n",
        "  * It typically consists of a dense layer with a softmax activation function, which outputs probabilities for different classes.\n",
        "4. **Masked Language Modeling (MLM):**\n",
        "\n",
        "  * One of the pre-training tasks used to train BERT.\n",
        "  * Some tokens in the input sequence are randomly masked (represented as \"[MASK]\" in the image).\n",
        "  * The model is then trained to predict the original masked tokens based on the context provided by the surrounding tokens.\n",
        "5. **Next Sentence Prediction (NSP):**\n",
        "\n",
        "  * Another pre-training task used to train BERT.\n",
        "  * Two sentences are input to the model, and the model is trained to predict whether the second sentence is the actual next sentence in the original text.\n",
        "\n",
        "Overall, the BERT model is trained on a massive amount of text data using the MLM and NSP tasks. This pre-training allows the model to learn a deep understanding of language and context, which can then be applied to a wide range of natural language processing tasks."

    "# Building a Powerful AI Research Agent with LangChain\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to build an AI research agent using the LangChain framework. The agent will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Plan Research:** Generate a structured research plan based on a user-provided topic.\n",
    "2. **Generate Queries:** Create specific search queries for each section of the plan.\n",
    "3. **Gather Information:** Use a web search tool (Tavily) to find relevant information.\n",
    "4. **Analyze Data:** Perform basic data analysis (if applicable).\n",
    "5. **Generate Report:** Compile the research into a well-formatted report.\n",

    "### What are AI Agents?\n",
    "\n",
    "AI agents are autonomous or semi-autonomous systems that can perceive their environment, make decisions, and take actions to achieve specific goals. LLM based AI agents take inspiration from traditional RL based AI Agents. They are built using large language models (LLMs) and can be equipped with tools to interact with the external world (e.g., search the web, access databases, or use APIs).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Features of AI Agents:**\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Reasoning:** Agents can use LLMs to reason about a task, break it down into smaller steps, and decide on the best course of action.\n",
    "-   **Tool Use:** Agents can be given access to tools, allowing them to perform actions beyond generating text (e.g., searching the web, analyzing data, interacting with APIs).\n",
    "-   **Memory:** Agents can have memory to store information from previous interactions, enabling them to learn and adapt over time.\n",
    "-   **Autonomy:** Agents can operate independently to a certain degree, making decisions and taking actions without constant human intervention.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In this lab, we will build a research agent that demonstrates these capabilities.**\n",

    "**Step-by-Step Breakdown:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Planning:**\n",
    "    \n",
    "    -   The agent receives a research topic from the user.\n",
    "    -   It uses the LLM to create a research plan in JSON format, outlining the report's title, sections, and placeholders for key findings and sources.\n",
    "    -   Each section in the plan has a name, a description, and a flag (`research`) indicating whether web research is needed.\n",
    "2. **Query Generation:**\n",
    "    \n",
    "    -   The agent examines the research plan.\n",
    "    -   For each section marked with `research=True`, it generates 2-3 specific search queries designed to find relevant information from high-quality sources.\n",
    "    -   These queries are added to the `queries` field of each section.\n",
    "3. **Information Gathering (Simulated Parallel):**\n",
    "    \n",
    "    -   The agent iterates through the sections of the plan.\n",
    "    -   For each section requiring research:\n",
    "        -   It uses the `tavily_search_results_json` tool (which wraps the Tavily Search API) to perform web searches for each of the section's queries.\n",
    "        -   To simulate parallel research, the agent will make multiple calls to the search tool within this step, one for each query. Although the calls are made sequentially, they are grouped together in this phase. Other agent-based libraries (LangGraph, PydanticAI, SmolAgents, etc. ) have functionality to directly do parallel research, but since we are using LangChain, it does not have that capability yet.\n",
    "        -   The agent then compiles the search results into the `content` field of the section.\n",
    "        -   It also keeps track of the sources used, storing them in the `sources` field of the plan.\n",
    "4. **Report Generation:**\n",
    "    \n",
    "    -   The agent uses the LLM to generate the final research report in JSON format.\n",
    "    -   For sections that required research, it uses the gathered content.\n",
    "    -   For sections that didn't require research (e.g., Introduction, Conclusion), it synthesizes information from the other sections and writes in an appropriate style.\n",
    "    -   The report includes the title, sections with content, a list of sources, and key findings.\n",
    "5. **Output:**\n",
    "    \n",
    "    -   The JSON report is formatted and presented to the user.\n",

    "- The custom `SafeTavilySearchResults` class wraps the `TavilySearchResults` tool to handle potential exceptions during web searches. This prevents the entire chatbot from crashing if the search tool encounters an error.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Research Agent Chains:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`planning_chain`:** Takes the user input and generates a research plan in JSON format, outlining the sections of the report, whether research is needed for each section, and initial descriptions.\n",
    "- **`query_generation_chain`:** Takes the research plan as input and generates specific search queries for each section that requires web research.\n",
    "- **`research_agent_executor`:** This is the core research execution component. It takes the plan with queries and orchestrates the web searches using the `search_tool` for the specific sections, extracts and summarizes the data from the search results, and creates a report structured with titles, descriptions, search data and URLs of the sources. It uses `create_openai_tools_agent` and `AgentExecutor`\n",
    "- **`report_generation_chain`:** Takes all of the research results and produces a structured `ResearchReport` object ready for the user. It builds the title, section's content, source URLs and key findings.\n",
    "\n",
    "**6. Markdown Report Formatting:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `_format_report_as_markdown` function converts the structured `ResearchReport` into a Markdown format, making it easier to read and display in a chatbot interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "**7. Chatbot Class:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `Chatbot` class encapsulates the chatbot's logic.\n",
    "    - It uses `ConversationBufferMemory` to store the conversation history, allowing the chatbot to maintain context across multiple turns.\n",
    "    - The `chat` method is the core of the chatbot. It takes the user input, checks if research is required, invokes the research agent chains if necessary, and returns the final report as a Markdown string. If no research is needed, it simply answers the user's query.\n",
    "    - The initial prompt instructs the LLM to respond with \"[RESEARCH]\" if research is requested. This avoids the need to parse the LLM's response for research intent.\n",
    "\n",
    "**8. Main Chat Loop:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The main chat loop continuously prompts the user for input, sends the input to the chatbot, and prints the chatbot's response. It handles the \"exit\" command to terminate the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Overall Flow:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **User Input:** The user enters a question or request.\n",
    "2.  **Chatbot Response:** The chatbot determines if the question requires research by analyzing the response of an LLM call to the user input.\n",
    "3.  **Research Agent (if needed):**\n",
    "    - If research is required:\n",
    "        - The `planning_chain` creates a research plan.\n",
    "        - The `query_generation_chain` generates search queries for the sections needing research.\n",
    "        - The `research_agent_executor` performs web searches using the tools.\n",
    "        - The `report_generation_chain` compiles the search results into a structured report.\n",
    "    - The report is formatted as Markdown.\n",
    "4.  **Chatbot Output:** The chatbot displays the research report in Markdown format or a regular chat response, depending on the user request.\n",

      "\n",
      "**Content:**\n",
      "In 2020, the housing market trends in Paris and Tokyo showed distinct characteristics influenced by various factors. In Paris, property prices experienced a modest downward trend but remained relatively stable compared to other major European cities. This stability was partly due to falling mortgage rates and strong international demand, which led to a 30% increase in real prices between 2015 and 2020. The anticipation of the 2024 Olympic Games in Paris also contributed to speculation about a potential property bubble, although prices managed to hold up well amidst these challenges. On the other hand, Tokyo's housing market was characterized by a rapid growth in housing stock, approximately 2% annually, which was faster than cities like Paris, London, or New York. This growth was driven by Tokyo's efficient city planning and a cultural preference for new homes, resulting in frequent demolition and replacement of older structures.\n",

    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Congratulations! You have now built a fully functional AI research agent using LangChain. This agent can plan research, generate search queries, gather information from the web, and compile a structured report.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Further Exploration:**\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Experiment with different research topics:** Try running the agent with various queries to see how it performs.\n",
    "-   **Customize the prompts:** Modify the prompts (planning, query generation, research, report generation) to fine-tune the agent's behavior and output quality.\n",
    "-   **Add more tools:** Explore other LangChain tools and integrate them into your agent to enhance its capabilities (e.g., tools for interacting with databases, APIs, or other data sources).\n",
    "-   **Implement more sophisticated memory:** Replace the simple list-based memory with a more advanced memory mechanism from LangChain to allow the agent to learn and improve over time.\n",
    "-   **Explore different agent architectures:** LangChain offers various agent types beyond `create_openai_tools_agent`. Investigate other agent architectures like ReAct agents or conversational agents to see which one best suits your needs.\n",
    "-   **Consider using LangGraph:** For more complex workflows and finer control over the agent's execution flow, explore LangGraph, which allows you to define state machines and manage agent operations using a graph-based approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "By experimenting and building upon this foundation, you can create even more powerful and sophisticated AI agents for various tasks. Remember that the field of AI agents is rapidly evolving, so stay up-to-date with the latest developments in LangChain and the broader AI community."
